# GreenTech Solutions 

Hey there! Welcome to our first version of the GreenTech Solutions website. This is where we started our journey to help businesses go green without breaking the bank.

## What This Is

This is a simple, semantic HTML5 landing page we built for GreenTech Solutions - our fictional (but totally realistic) sustainable tech company. Think of it as the "hello world" of green business websites, but way more polished.

### Why We Built This

We needed a clean, accessible website that would:
- Show businesses we're legit and know our stuff
- Explain our services without the usual corporate BS
- Actually work for people using screen readers and other assistive tech
- Rank well on Google (because what's the point of a great site if nobody finds it?)

## What's Inside

The site covers our three main services:
- **Solar installations** that actually make financial sense
- **Smart building automation** that doesn't require a PhD to understand
- **Sustainability consulting** for companies tired of greenwashing

Plus some client testimonials, company info, and all the usual landing page stuff you'd expect.

## Tech Stack (Spoiler: It's Refreshingly Simple)

- **HTML5** - That's it. No frameworks, no fancy build tools, no JavaScript libraries.
- **Semantic markup** - We used proper HTML elements instead of div soup
- **Zero dependencies** - Opens in any browser from 2010 onwards

### Why Just HTML?

Sometimes you don't need React for everything. This v1 proves you can build something professional and accessible with just good old HTML. Plus:
- Loads instantly (even on slow connections)
- Works with JavaScript disabled
- Easy for anyone on the team to edit
- Search engines love it

## What Makes It Special

### Accessibility First
- Proper heading hierarchy (h1 → h2 → h3, no skipping)
- ARIA landmarks for screen readers
- Meaningful link text (no "click here" nonsense)
- Semantic HTML elements that actually mean something

### SEO Ready
- Meta tags that don't suck
- Open Graph tags for social media
- Structured content that Google can understand
- Internal linking that makes sense

### Real-World Content
Instead of Lorem ipsum, we wrote actual business copy that:
- Addresses real pain points (high energy costs)
- Uses specific numbers and examples
- Sounds like humans wrote it, not marketing robots

## The File Structure

```
├── index.html          # The whole site (yep, just one file)
└── README.md          # You're reading it!
```

Told you it was simple.

## Getting Started

1. Download `index.html`
2. Open it in any browser
3. That's literally it

Want to edit it? Open in any text editor. No build process, no npm install, no "it works on my machine" issues.

## What We Learned

Building this taught us a few things:
- **Semantic HTML is powerful** - Using `<article>`, `<section>`, and `<aside>` properly makes content way more accessible
- **Less is often more** - One well-structured HTML file beats a bloated framework for simple sites
- **Content is king** - All the fancy CSS in the world can't fix boring, generic copy

## What's Next (v2 Ideas)

We're keeping this version as-is for reference, but future versions might include:
- [ ] Basic CSS for styling (while keeping the clean HTML structure)
- [ ] Contact form with simple JavaScript
- [ ] Image gallery of completed projects
- [ ] Blog section for SEO content
- [ ] Mobile-optimized CSS Grid layout
